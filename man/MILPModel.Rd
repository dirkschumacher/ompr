\title{Experimental: Create a new MILP Model}
\usage{
MILPModel()
}
\description{
Create an an empty mixed-integer linear programming model that is
about 1000 times faster than `MIPModel`.
}
\details{
Please only use it if you can deal with potential API changes in the future.
When you use `MILPModel` make sure to always model your problem with
`MIPModel` as well, just to make sure you get the same results.

It is also always a good idea to test your model with very small input sizes
and examine the coefficients and rows of the constraint matrix.
