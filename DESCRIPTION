Title: Model and Solve Mixed Integer Linear Programs
Version: 0.8.1.9001

Description: Model mixed integer linear programs in an algebraic way directly in R.
             The model is solver-independent and thus offers the possibility
             to solve a model with different solvers. It currently only supports
             linear constraints and objective functions. See the 'ompr'
             website <https://dirkschumacher.github.io/ompr/> for more information,
             documentation and examples.
